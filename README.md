#elephant 3D Computer Graphics Project 
Computer Graphics 20562 2021b mmn 17
The project was written as part of the course " 20652 - Computer Graphics" in my degree (Computer Science at the Open University).
I developed a three-dimensional world containing an elephant in a safari, trees, and several different objects using OpenGL.
The user can control the movement of the elephant (and parts of it), the world view and the camera.
The world has ambient lighting and a point light source that can also be controlled.
